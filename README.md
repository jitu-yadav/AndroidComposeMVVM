📱 Android Sample App – MVVM + Jetpack Compose + Hilt + Navigation

This is a sample Android project showcasing modern Android development best practices using MVVM architecture, Jetpack Compose for UI, Hilt for dependency injection, and Navigation Compose for in-app navigation.

🚀 Features

✅ MVVM Architecture – clean separation of concerns (UI, ViewModel, Repository).

✅ Jetpack Compose – fully declarative UI with state management.

✅ Hilt – dependency injection for ViewModels, repositories, and other classes.

✅ Navigation Compose – single-activity architecture with graph-based navigation.

✅ State handling – using StateFlow / LiveData to update UI reactively.

✅ Scalable structure – easily extendable for larger apps.
